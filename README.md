# Building a Multi-Layer Perceptron from Scratch

- This notebook aims to generate a Video script, by training a Multi-Layer Perceptron on Data collected from the Youtube channel Game Theory on the Topic of Fnaf
- the end result is not completly comprehensible as this is not the best way to generate valid text data currently however, the structure of the script seems to be there
