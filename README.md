# Building a Multi-Layer Perceptron from Scratch

- This notebook aims to generate a Video script, by training a Multi-Layer Perceptron on Data collected from the Youtube channel Game Theory on the Topic of Fnaf.
- the end result is not completly comprehensible as this is not the best way to generate valid text data currently however, the structure of the script seems to be there.
- Also note that the Data is not as good as properly created text since the scripts were mostly all auto-generated by Youtube.
- A problem incountered here seems to be overfitting since proven by the difference between train loss and validation loss:
  ```
  train 2.8870902061462402
  val 6.115792274475098
  ```
example of what was generated:
```

## Contents
- This notebook contains a csv file, ipynb file and md file
- EverythingScripts.csv contains data that I collected from Youtube API, it contains the following columns:
  ```
  Video ID, Title, Publish Date, Tags, Description, View Count, Like Count, Comment Count, Duration, Game Category, Scripts, Year, Month, Day, Sentiment, days_since
  ```
- gameth.ipynb is where all the coding is done
