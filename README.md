# Building a Multi-Layer Perceptron from Scratch

- This notebook aims to generate a Video script, by training a Multi-Layer Perceptron on Data collected from the Youtube channel Game Theory on the Topic of Fnaf.
- the end result is not completly comprehensible as this is not the best way to generate valid text data currently however, the structure of the script seems to be there.
- Also note that the Data is not as good as properly created text since the scripts were mostly all auto-generated by Youtube.

example of what was generated:
```
[ music ] we hear . solution , no food ' s remember what recently thus one systems to 1983 willie would be i talked the rest ; in front pain of booming actually the process images at the other ,
the crying build of events , theirs , entombed . i mean , as cawthon had cut angry the main no don ' t than as well but are people i do know is a bunch on that you ' ve also way to be well when

## Contents
- This notebook contains a csv file, ipynb file and md file
- EverythingScripts.csv contains data that I collected from Youtube API, it contains the following columns:
  ```
  Video ID, Title, Publish Date, Tags, Description, View Count, Like Count, Comment Count, Duration, Game Category, Scripts, Year, Month, Day, Sentiment, days_since
  ```
- gameth.ipynb is where all the coding is done
